# Challenge Description

The goal of this challenge is to create a Yield Aggregator. The user will interact with a React website which will talk to your aggregator smart contract to deposit their WETH into either Compound V3 or Aave V3 depending on which application provides a better APY. Since the APY changes overtime, the user can rebalance their funds to move funds from one application to another, and they can also withdraw at any time.
